# How to develop and deploy the project?

1. Create a new GitHub repository using an appropriate server-side framework template (Node.js, PHP, or Python).
2. Place your solution code inside the `/src` folder.
3. Set up your database schema and import initial data from CSV files in `/assets/module-B/initial-data/`.
4. Configure your server-side framework with database connection settings.
5. Pushing to GitHub triggers GitHub Actions (see `.github/`) to:
   - Build a Docker image with your server-side application
   - Push it to GitHub Container Registry
6. In `docker-compose.yml`, update:
   `image: ghcr.io/<your-github-account>/<your-repo-name>:latest`
7. Run locally:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
8. Visit: [http://localhost](http://localhost)

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Text editor or IDE (VS Code, PHPStorm, or similar)
- Database management system (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite)
- Server-side runtime environment:
  - **PHP**: PHP 8.0+ with Composer
  - **Node.js**: Node.js 16+ with npm/yarn
  - **Python**: Python 3.8+ with pip
- Modern web browser for testing
- Database administration tool (phpMyAdmin, pgAdmin, or similar)

### Getting Started

1. Choose your preferred server-side framework from the Infrastructure List
2. Set up your local development environment with the chosen framework
3. Create and configure your database connection
4. Import initial data from CSV files in `/assets/module-B/initial-data/`
5. Implement the database schema according to requirements
6. Set up user authentication and session management
7. Create the restaurant dashboard interface

### Framework Options

#### PHP with Laravel
- Use Laravel's built-in authentication system
- Implement Eloquent ORM for database operations
- Use Blade templating for server-side rendering

#### Node.js with Express
- Use Passport.js for authentication
- Implement with Sequelize or Prisma ORM
- Use EJS or Handlebars for server-side rendering

#### Python with Django
- Use Django's built-in authentication system
- Implement with Django ORM
- Use Django templates for server-side rendering

### Security Implementation

- Hash passwords using bcrypt or similar
- Implement CSRF protection
- Sanitize all user inputs to prevent SQL injection and XSS
- Use secure session management
- Implement proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

### Testing and Validation

- Test all authentication flows (login, logout, session management)
- Verify role-based access control works correctly
- Test CRUD operations for menu items, reservations, and reviews
- Validate security measures against common vulnerabilities
- Test database operations and data integrity
- Verify proper error handling and user feedback

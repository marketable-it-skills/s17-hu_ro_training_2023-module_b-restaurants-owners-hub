Carefully review the provided detailed description of the dynamic website's account management functionalities. Understand the various tasks and actions that users need to perform within their accounts.

## Task List:

### 1. Database Design:

Design a robust and efficient database schema to accommodate user accounts and related data.
Identify the necessary tables, relationships, and fields required for account management.
Ensure proper normalization and data integrity in the database design.
Utilize the provided example CSV files to import initial data into the database. CSV files can be found in the assets/module-B/initial-data folder.
Develop a script or mechanism to parse and import CSV data into relevant database tables.
Address any data normalization challenges that may arise from the provided CSV data.

### 2. User Authentication and Security:

- Implement a secure user authentication system to enable users to create and access accounts.
  Utilize encryption and hashing techniques to store and manage user passwords securely. Implement account locking mechanisms to enhance account security.
- Design a system that supports two user roles: "dineEasyAdmin" and "restaurantAdmin". DineEasy admins will have access to the entire system, while restaurant administrators will have access only to their respective restaurant's data.
- Develop a user registration mechanism for restaurant administrator roles. Capture essential information, including email address (as username), password, name, restaurant name, type and location. Implement appropriate validation for email address field. Enable the uploading of image for restaurant logo.
- Create a login form that authenticates users based on their role. Administrators should be redirected to the admin dashboard, while restaurant administrators should be directed to their respective restaurant's dashboard upon successful login.
- Implement a mechanism to lock user accounts after three failed login attempts. Determine 30 seconds duration for which the account should be locked out. Users should be notified about the account lockout and provided with information about the lock out duration.
- Configure protected routes that are accessible only after successful user authentication. Implement role-based access control to restrict certain actions to authorized users. Ensure that sensitive account information is accessible only to the respective account owner and dineEasy admins.
- Create two sample user for both roles:

| email                    | name        | role            | restaurantId | password |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | --------------- | ------------ | -------- |
| ferenc.kis@sze.hu        | Ferenc Kis  | restaurantAdmin | 1            | 12345678 |
| laszlo.nagy@dineeasy.com | Laszlo Nagy | dineEasyAdmin   |              | 12345678 |

- When the authenticated user click on the Logout link they will be logged out and redirected to the login page.

### 3. Restaurant's dashboard:
